git-sparse-checkout(1)
=======================

NAME
----
git-sparse-checkout - Initialize and modify the sparse-checkout
configuration, which reduces the checkout to a set of directories
given by a list of prefixes.


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git sparse-checkout [init|add|list]'


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Initialize and modify the sparse-checkout configuration, which reduces
the checkout to a set of directories given by a list of prefixes.


COMMANDS
--------
'init'::
	Enable the `core.sparseCheckout` setting and clear all folders not
	included by the sparse-checkout file. Typically, no sparse-checkout
	file will exist when this command is run, so all directories in the
	working directory will be removed.

'add'::
	Given a list of paths over stdin, add those paths to the
	sparse-checkout file. Refresh the index and working directory to
	place the necessary files on disk.

'list'::
	Provide a list of the contents in the sparse-checkout file.


SPARSE CHECKOUT
----------------

The sparse-checkout feature provides simple way to reduce the "cone" of files
in the working directory which are populated by Git. The sparse-checkout file
specifies a list of directories from the working directory root, and the list
of paths included are as follows:

1. Any path that is contained in a folder listed in the sparse-checkout file.
   For example, if `A/B/C` is in the sparse-checkout file, then `A/B/C/D/e.txt`
   will exist in the working directory.

2. Any path whose immediate parent folder is an ancestor of a folder listed in
   the sparse-checkout file. For example, all files in the root directory are
   included -- even if the sparse-checkout file is empty. As another example,
   if `A/B/C` is in the sparse-checkout file, then `A/foo.txt` and `A/B/bar.c`
   would be included. Note that `A/F/xyz.h` would not be included, as its
   immediate parent (`A/F`) is not a prefix of `A/B/C`.

Note that the pattern matching in the sparse-checkout feature is very restricted,
unlike the sparse-checkout feature. The sparse-checkout and sparse-checkout
features both use the skip-worktree bits in the index file to interact with
other features in Git, but otherwise are incompatible. Creating a sparse-checkout
file to include files according to the rules above is difficult, and the
pattern matching required by the sparse-checkout feature leads to quadratic
growth: for N patterns and M index entries, we must check O(N * M) patterns.

Conversely, the sparse-checkout feature does not allow negative patterns or
file-name based patterns. If you want to exclude all files ending in ".exe"
you could include the line `!*.exe` in the sparse-checkout file. This is not
available in the sparse-checkout feature.

To use the sparse-checkout feature, you must enable the `core.partialCheckout`
config setting. This setting will override the `core.sparseCheckout` setting,
so any values in the sparse-checkout file will be ignored.

To initialize an existing repo to use the sparse-checkout feature, run
`git sparse-checkout init`. This will enable `core.partialCheckout`, remove
all directories in the root of the working directory, and then update the
working directory to contain the folders that may already exist in the
sparse-checkout file. In the usual case, the sparse-checkout file will be
empty and you will only see files in the working directory root.

To add folders to the sparse-checkout file, run the `add` subcommand, and
provide the list over standard-in:

```
$git sparse-checkout add
A/B/C
Docs
tests
^D
```

Since these folders do not exist in your working directory, you can use
`git ls-tree HEAD -- <path>` to help discover folders that exist in your
repo.

After adding the folders to the sparse-checkout file, Git will update the index
and run `git reset --hard` to place the files on disk. Due to the use of
`git reset --hard`, the command will halt with an error before doing any work
if you do not have a clean `git status`.

If you wish to reduce your working directory, you can use the
`git sparse-checkout remove` subcommand. It takes a list of folders from
standard in, removes them from the sparse-checkout file and deletes them from
your working directory, then runs `git reset --hard` to ensure the index is
up to date.

To check which folders are included in the sparse-checkout file, run the
`git sparse-checkout list` subcommand.
